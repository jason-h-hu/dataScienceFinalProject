# Overview

We're using AngularJS + Bootstrap as a web framework, with Gulp as the build system behind it all.

## Files
- src: all code for web
	- index.html: has top level HTML and meta information
	- main.scss: imports all other SASS, and has global variables
	- folders for each view: each has a .scss, a .js, and .tpl.html file representing the view
