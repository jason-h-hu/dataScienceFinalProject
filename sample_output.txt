The hostess gave us a genuine smile and showed us to our table, a four seater in the back by the full glass windows that overlooked the river. It's the details that made me give this place such a high rating. For example, the square table was rotated so that the two of us were seated next to each other, both with uninhibited views of the river. The other two places at the table were cleared immediately.\n\nEthan, our waiter, was well dressed, held himself with good posture, and was very courteous. In a lot of upscale restaurants, I've found that waiters often end being impersonal and snooty. Ethan was friendly and very easy to talk to. The owner has obviously put a lot of effort into finding good staff.\n\nI asked about a wine I didn't recognize, thinking that the name was of a grape variety I hadn't heard of since the other wines in that grouping were named by their grapes. He didn't know about the wine, but offered to learn the details. Normally, one should know the wines on the list, but I was impressed regardless when, within one minute he came back with the bottle, told me the variety of grape (which wasn't its name, by the way) and its expected taste profile. I knew the grape and wondered out loud if it was a Spanish wine. Right away, he said this one was Portuguese. After the standard taste testing that is pretty much a waste of time except when an older bottle is bought, it was served in an ice bucket and he attentively topped our glasses throughout our meal more or less the number of times that keeps one happy but not feeling interrupted. \n\nThe rolls were served warm and kept warm by a wrapped cloth. They were flaky and delicate. The butter had been pre-softened in its container. I usually skip the bread, but that day I ate it all. \n\nSo much for a light lunch. I tried their version of clam chowder, which is a New England style. There was lots of everything and it was clearly made often. The clams were not chewy, as often occurs when large batches are reheated and overcooked. It reminded me of the chowders made off the docks in Seattle, WA, which are the best. I recommend it.\n\nI've been a sucker for burgers lately. Since I threw the idea of eating light out the window, I ordered one. I did skip the fries and ordered the vegetable side dish. Again, the details are what impressed me. The bun was perfectly toasted, the accompaniments were flavorful and sized properly. The meat was an exact medium rare, not over salted, and of excellent quality. Attention was paid to the proper fat ratio, as it was not dense, but held together well. This is impressive because, in a seafood restaurant, burgers are on the menu as an obligatory item, but the kitchen paid as much detail to it as any dish. Even the vegetables were quite good and not an afterthought- similar to ratatouille I suppose, except instead of tomatoes they used brussel sprouts and everything was lightly char-grilled with a bit of olive oil.\n\nOverall, it deserves my five stars. I am curious if the kitchen and wait staff are able to keep up with their level of quality when the room fills up. I suspect they are."}, {'review_author': u'Ashi Scott-Bey', 'review_star': 2, 'review_text': u"My 90yr old mom & myself went here for lunch on a warmer Saturday during Jan 2015.

Good food, we\'ll be back. One thing we noted that the ambiance doesn\'t work well. The decor reflects hints of Japanese culture, but there\'s that odd flintstones painting, the blood decals by the entrance, an 8-bit poster, and the music they\'re playing was hip hop. It feels like a jumble of random "cool stuff" which takes off the "authentic feel" of the otherwise well crafted arrangement and selection of furniture that gives the Japanese ambiance. If that doesn\'t detract you from eating, they serve pretty good food with a pretty quick service time. You may just have to wait a bit as it does get a fair number of people and seating isn\'t plenty.

It doesn't seem like these people have eaten at Local 121 in Providence, RI...\n\nFrom my experience, Local 121 is a gem! It's located in downtown Providence, RI. If you want an extraordinary dinning experience, this is the place. You will be treated as a pampered guest from start to finish. Our Local 121 evening began with valet parking which was appreciated by us out-of-towners. We received a warm welcome and were seated immediately at a table we had reserved weeks prior. The dining room is a beauty. They got it right. Old world original architectural details and modern aesthetics are at work here, along with lighting that flattered everyone in the place, me included. A great start to one of the best meals my husband and I have ever had in Providence, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. \n\nThe menu offers local fare with some unusual seasonal ingredients. Our Seared Scallops appetizer included grapefruit, crunchy roasted cashews and mizuna, a type of mustard green, which might seem challenging for some people. Don't be put off. The texture and flavor combinations are terrific. Same goes for the Calamari, which is wildly crispy, and elevated to new heights when eaten with the marinated slaw accompaniment. One of our mains was a carefully prepared Duck Breast. Wow. Rich and earthy melded perfectly with a bit of sweet muscat grapes and beets. Delicious. We were stuffed but didn't want to leave, so we indulged further with an ice cream board dessert. It topped off a perfect culinary experience. In all, Local 121 is why we self-admitted foodies go out to eat -- for excellent inventive food whose beautiful presentation is second only to each well-crafted taste sensation. The outstanding service - a food and wine savvy staff - made our night extra memorable. I highly recommend Local 121. \nIt doesn't get any better than this!
